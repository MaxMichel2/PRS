Initially:
cwnd = 1;
ssthresh = infinite;
New ack received:
if (cwnd < ssthresh)
 /* Slow Start*/
 cwnd = cwnd + 1;
else
 /* Congestion Avoidance */
 cwnd = cwnd + 1/cwnd;
Timeout:
/* Multiplicative decrease */
ssthresh = cwnd/2;
cwnd = 1; 

ssthresh = cwnd / 2
cwnd = ssthresh
Instead of setting cwnd to 1, cut cwnd in half (multiplicative
decrease)
For each dup ack arrival
dupack++
Indicates packet left network, so we may be able to send more
MaxWindow = min(cwnd + dupack, AdvWin)
Receive ack for new data (beyond initial dup ack)
dupack = 0
Exit fast recovery
But when RTO expires still do cwnd = 1
